resource "vcd_vapp_network" "vappNet" {
  org = "my-org" # Optional
  vdc = "my-vdc" # Optional

  name               = "my-net"
  vapp_name          = "my-vapp"
  gateway            = "192.168.2.1"
  netmask            = "255.255.255.0"

  dns_suffix         = "mybiz.biz"
  guest_vlan_allowed = true

  static_ip_pool {
    start_address = "192.168.2.51"
    end_address   = "192.168.2.100"
  }

  dhcp_pool {
    start_address = "192.168.2.2"
    end_address   = "192.168.2.50"

* `dns_suffix` - (Optional) A FQDN for the virtual machines on this network.
* `guest_vlan_allowed` (Optional) True if Network allows guest VLAN tagging.
* `static_ip_pool` - (Optional) A range of IPs permitted to be used as static IPs for virtual machines; see [IP Pools](#ip-pools) below for details.
* `dhcp_pool` - (Optional) A range of IPs to issue to virtual machines that don't have a static IP; see [IP Pools](#ip-pools) below for details.
* `org_network_name` - (Optional; *v2.7+*) An Org network name to which vApp network is connected. If not configured, then an isolated network is created.

* `end_address` - (Required) The final address in the IP Range.

DHCP Pools additionally support the following attributes:

* `default_lease_time` - (Optional) The default DHCP lease time to use. Defaults to `3600`.

## Importing

~> **Note:** The current implementation of Terraform import can only import resources into the state.
It does not generate configuration. [More information.](https://www.terraform.io/docs/import/)

An existing vApp Network can be [imported][docs-import] into this resource
via supplying the full dot separated path for vApp Network. An example is below:

[docs-import]: https://www.terraform.io/docs/import/

```
terraform import vcd_vapp_network.imported org-name.vdc-name.vapp-name.network-name
```

NOTE: the default separator (.) can be changed using Provider.import_separator or variable VCD_IMPORT_SEPARATOR

The above command would import the vApp Network named `network-name` that is defined on vApp `vapp-name` 
which is configured in organization named `my-org` and VDC named `my-org-vdc`.
